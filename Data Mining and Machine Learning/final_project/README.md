The goal of the project was to help a chess team maximize their performance, by recommending them the best game opening strategies based on several criteria.

The dataset contained data from over 20k games of chess. The features included: ELO ratings of players, the opening strategy, game length and duration, and outcome (who won).

Coding was done in R. I've used two different models: logistic regression, and a neural network. Model performance was evaluated based on the proportion of correct predictions in the testing set.
