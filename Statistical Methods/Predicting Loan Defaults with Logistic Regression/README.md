Goal: using a dataset with various data about bank loan applicants (loan amount, loan term, interest rate, monthly payment amount, income, etc - a total of 30 features), predict which applicants are likely to default on their loans.

This is an R project. The model that was used here (this was a project requirement) is `glm()` - logistic regression.

I show here part1 and part2 of an early version of the project, with professor's notes and comments.
